# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

## Path Planning Details
This project's path generation implementation is based on ideas seen in the [Optimal Trajectory Generation for Dynamic Street Scenarios in a Frenet Frame](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224156269_Optimal_Trajectory_Generation_for_Dynamic_Street_Scenarios_in_a_Frenet_Frame) paper.

### Behavior Selection Steps
1. If there is a vehicle close ahead
  1. If the left lane is available
    1. Change lane left
  1. Else if the right lane is available
    1. change lane right
  1. Else slow down
1. Else
  1. If to the right of center and left lane is available
    1. Change lane left
  1. Else if to the left of center and the right lane is available
    1. Change lane right
  1. Else maintain target speed

### Trajectory Generation Steps
1. For each strategy chosen by the behavior layer, generate several min-jerk trajectories probabalistically.
1. For each generated trajectory, judge its cost via several cost functions.
1. For the trajectory with the lowest cost, convert that from Frenet to XY coordinates and emit a path.

#### Cost Functions
The following cost functions and weights are used:

// Nice to have
const float LANE_CENTER = 0.45;
const float EFFICIENCY = 1.4;
const float SLOW = 0.25;
const float SHORT = 0.5;

// Need to have
const float MAX_JERK = 0.9;
const float MAX_ACCELERATION = 0.85;
const float TOTAL_ACCELERATION = 0.85;
const float MAX_VELOCITY = 0.8;
const float STAY_ON_ROAD = 0.95;

// Critical
const float COLLISION = 10.0;

Collision is given the highest weight so that we attempt to never take a path that collides with another vehicle.

#### Collision Detection
To detect collisions, the position of the ego and other vehicles are predicted out to a 2s horizon. If the ego comes within a 2.5m radius of another car within that time, a collision cost is added. For non-ego cars, it helped to assume a negative acceleration of 2.5 m/s^2 to account for uncertainty around non-ego vehicles applying brakes.

#### Path Continuity
To keep path continuinity upon re-planning, which is done whenever the simulator asks for more data, the position, velocity, and acceleration of each step of the current trajectory is stored. Upon re-planning, the position, velocity, and acceleration from the first unprocessed step are used as the starting point of all generated trajectories. This allows for re-planning at any point in the path whilst achieving some min-jerk trajectory at all times.

#### Waypoint Interpolation
The provided waypoints are quite far apart. Naively navigating from waypoint to waypoint produces sharp turns at each point. To alleviate this in this project, waypoints are interpolated 100x via cubic splines, which results in a much smoother path.

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single header file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
